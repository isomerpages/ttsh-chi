## CHI Health &amp; Social Change Academy 

The first of its kind, the CHI Health and Social Change Academy, through **“Comm-PACT”** is an important step towards levelling up capabilities to scale our efforts in building CoCs for a Healthier SG.

<b>Comm-PACT"</b> , as a capability building suite, brings together care providers, health and social partners and residents, as communities, into a **social learning space** for (the):

<li><b>Population</b> – Drive integration of health and social care, focus on health of vulnerable groups, and improve overall health of residents.</li>

<li><b>Activation</b> – Enable communities and individuals to take action to improve and maintain their health.</li>

<li><b>Collaboration</b> – Build collective leadership and collaborative partnerships through engagement, teaming and networks.</li>

<li><b>Transformation</b> – Harness the power of social movements to scale health and wellbeing of the population.</li>

Through its nine stackable modules, the Academy will equip participants with essential skills, knowledge, and tools to be activators, collaborators and agents of transformation for community health.
