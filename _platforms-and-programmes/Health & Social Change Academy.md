## CHI Health & Social Change Academy 

The first of its kind, the CHI Health and Social Change Academy (HSCA), through **“Comm-PACT”** is an important step towards levelling up capabilities to scale our efforts in building CoCs for a Healthier SG.

**"Comm-PACT",** as a capability building suite, brings together care providers, health and social partners and residents, as communities, into a **social learning space** for (the):

•       **P****opulation** – Drive integration of health and social care, focus on health of vulnerable groups, and improve overall health of residents.

•       **A****ctivation** – Enable communities and individuals to take action to improve and maintain their health.

•       **C****ollaboration** – Build collective leadership and collaborative partnerships through engagement, teaming and networks.

•       **T****ransformation** – Harness the power of social movements to scale health and wellbeing of the population.

Through its nine stackable modules, HSCA will equip participants with essential skills, knowledge, and tools to be activators, collaborators and agents of transformation for community health.
