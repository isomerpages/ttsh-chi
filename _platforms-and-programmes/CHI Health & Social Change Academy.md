The first of its kind, the CHI Health and Social Change Academy (HSCA) equips participants with essential skills, knowledge, and tools to be activators, collaborators and agents of transformation for happier and healthier communities.

Through “Comm-PACT”, a capability building suite of 9 stackable modules across 4 strategic programmes, the Health and Social Change Academy is an important step towards levelling up capabilities to scale our efforts in building Communities of Care (CoCs) for a Healthier SG.
