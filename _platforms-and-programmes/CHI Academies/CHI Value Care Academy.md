<h2>About the Value Academy (VA)</h2>
<p>The CHI Value Academy aims to develop capability by equipping healthcare
professionals with value-based improvement toolkits across Value-Based
Care, Outcomes, Payments and Incentives, enabling them to enhance their

project coaching, the Value Academy aims to empower healthcare professionals
to lead and implement value-based care innovations not just within their
organizations, but with opportunities for adoption and scale beyond institution.</p>
