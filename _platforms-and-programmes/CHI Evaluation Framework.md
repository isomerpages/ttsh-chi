<h2><strong>CHI Evaluation Framework</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>The CHI Evaluation Framework (CHIEF) is a holistic framework for evaluation
of innovation solutions that are seeking real-world deployment. Dependent
on the readiness of the solution, it would provide insights on the potential
for adoption or scale. It provides recommendations for the entire process,
from test-bed design for evidence generation, to economic analysis, to
solution evaluation by representative panels of experts.</p>
