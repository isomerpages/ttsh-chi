<p><strong>About Company</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IRegained is a Digital Neurotherapeutics (DTx) company that has developed
the MyHand® System, a FDA Health Canada &amp; HSA registered, patented,
smart, neuro-rehabilitation system to “rewire” damaged neural pathways
through the power of neuroplasticity, empowering people with a stroke,
TBI or musculoskeletal hand injury, reclaim unassisted use of their hands&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>About Solution</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IRegained has developed the MyHand System, a proprietary targeted hand
function rehabilitation system which aims to restore lost hand function
in individuals who have sustained a stroke or brain trauma or trauma to
the hand from other neuromuscular or musculo-skeletal injuries/disorders.
It leverages neuroplasticity, the human brain’s ability to ‘reprogram’
its neural pathways and thereby restore lost hand function.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The MyHand® System is an FDA, Health Canada and HSA (Singapore) registered,
patented, targeted hand-function rehabilitation system, consisting of a
connected mechatronic device, cloud-based proprietary hand-function training
protocols, specifically designed therapeutic games that encourage a patient’s
active engagement in their therapy. Therapy can be delivered by the mechatronic
device both in-person in the clinic, as well as through remote virtual
rehabilitation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>IReganed’s MyHand® System can be used in rehab centers, recreation clubs
and through remote tele-rehabilitation guidance from rehabilitation professionals.
Our novel system engages a patient’s sensory system (touch, pressure, and
proprioception sensation) and motor capabilities (various hand and forearm
muscles) for a more comprehensive rehabilitation approach to help restore
hand function.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>About Solution&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our proposed solution, the PreciS Health Management System, is designed
to enhance the chronic diseases management in Singapore and beyond, particularly
for high-risk elderly individuals who may not regularly access healthcare
services. By raising public health awareness and improving aging-related
chronic disease management, we aim to benefit both the public health and
individuals.&nbsp;
<br>

<p>In partnership with SGO, we will introduce a door-to-door health screening
initiative, involving visiting homes to perform point-of-care tests for
key health parameters such as HbA1c, a full lipid profile, and blood pressure,
utilizing our handheld analyzers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Powered by the HbA1c handheld solution, co-developed by SG Diagnostics
and the National Healthcare Group, the screening process is streamlined
and efficient. All data will be securely stored in the cloud and, ideally,
shared in real-time with healthcare providers to facilitate immediate follow-up
and care.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond health screenings, we will use this opportunity to educate individuals
on chronic disease management, including key programs such as Healthier
SG, the War on Diabetes initiative, and practical diabetes management tips.
Our solution aims to advance early detection and awareness of chronic diseases,
enhance public health efforts, and support timely intervention and better
health management within the community.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>About Company</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Occutrack is developing a home eye-tracking system to monitor age-related
macular degeneration (AMD), improving patient compliance by reducing clinic
visits. This enables timely assessments and interventions to prevent vision
loss and enhance quality of life for AMD patients.&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>About Solution&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Occutrack is a medical startup developing an eye movement tracking AI
‘CRYSTALSIGHT’ for home use to monitor and manage visual deterioration.
The focus is on age-related macular degeneration (AMD) using advanced eye-tracking
AI. Occutrack’s CRYSTALSIGHT gaze interrogation algorithm tracks eye movements
in response to visual stimuli, analyzes the data for abnormalities, and
assesses visual performance. This non-invasive process helps detect and
monitor conditions like AMD, allowing for convenient home-based eye health
management. Normal human vision consists of a series of quick eye movements
called saccades. These rapid eye movements have ballistic behaviour and
abruptly change the fixation point depending on the area of the person's
eye. By tracking these optokinetic movements with displayed patterns on
the screen, the health of one’s eyes can be determined.&nbsp;</p>
