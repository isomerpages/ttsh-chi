<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p><strong>About Company</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SG Diagnostics is a medical device company specializing in point-of-care
testing for chronic diseases, including HbA1c and lipid profile tests.
Our mission is to enhance lives by empowering individuals with greater
health awareness through accessible and accurate testing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>About Solution&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our proposed solution, the PreciS Health Management System, is designed
to enhance the chronic diseases management in Singapore and beyond, particularly
for high-risk elderly individuals who may not regularly access healthcare
services. By raising public health awareness and improving aging-related
chronic disease management, we aim to benefit both the public health and
individuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In partnership with SGO, we will introduce a door-to-door health screening
initiative, involving visiting homes to perform point-of-care tests for
key health parameters such as HbA1c, a full lipid profile, and blood pressure,
utilizing our handheld analyzers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Powered by the HbA1c handheld solution, co-developed by SG Diagnostics
and the National Healthcare Group, the screening process is streamlined
and efficient. All data will be securely stored in the cloud and, ideally,
shared in real-time with healthcare providers to facilitate immediate follow-up
and care.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond health screenings, we will use this opportunity to educate individuals
on chronic disease management, including key programs such as Healthier
SG, the War on Diabetes initiative, and practical diabetes management tips.
Our solution aims to advance early detection and awareness of chronic diseases,
enhance public health efforts, and support timely intervention and better
health management within the community.&nbsp;</p>
