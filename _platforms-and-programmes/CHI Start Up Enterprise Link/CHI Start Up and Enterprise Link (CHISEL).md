<h2> Centre for Healthcare Innovation Start-Up Enterprise Link (CHISEL) </h2>

Centre for Healthcare Innovation Start-Up Enterprise Link (CHISEL) is a programme that aims to accelerate the adoption of market-ready healthcare innovations that are fit for mainstream use, at speed at scale. <br>

It provides a sandbox and marketplace that enables start-ups and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to demonstrate proof-of-value (POV) of market ready or near market-ready solutions, with the aim of procurement for use by healthcare institutions. It enables start-ups and SMEs to access real use cases and environments, demonstrate POV of market-ready or near market-ready solutions, and customise solutions suited for implementation within healthcare clusters in Singapore. <br>

Simultaneously, healthcare clusters are able to evaluate the operational feasibility of solutions prior to adoption or scale-up. The platform aims to bridge the market adoption gap, and allow patients early access to new and emerging healthcare innovations to meet healthcare gaps. <br>

An end to end process that moves a potential solution from proof of value to adoption <br>
