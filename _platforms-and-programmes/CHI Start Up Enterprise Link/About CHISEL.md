<h1>About CHISEL</h1>
<p>&nbsp;Centre for Healthcare Innovation Start-Up Enterprise Link (CHISEL)
is a programme that aims to accelerate the adoption of market-ready healthcare
innovations that are fit for mainstream use, at speed at scale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;It provides a sandbox and marketplace that enables start-ups and
small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to access real use cases and environments
and demonstrate proof-of-value (POV) of market-ready or near-market-ready
solutions with one of the three Singapore healthcare clusters as a primary
collaborative test-bed site. The eventual aim is to bridge the gap between
market-ready solutions and adoption, aiming for procurement for use by
healthcare institutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Simultaneously, healthcare clusters can evaluate the operational
feasibility of solutions before adoption or scale-up. The platform aims
to bridge the market adoption gap and allow patients early access to new
and emerging healthcare innovations to meet healthcare gaps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Over four successful runs from 2021 to 2024, over 800 innovators
across more than 70 countries competed, and 14 companies were selected
to test-bed their solutions that could enhance patient care and deliver
positive health outcomes.</p>
<h3>An end-to-end process that moves a potential solution from proof of value to adoption</h3>
