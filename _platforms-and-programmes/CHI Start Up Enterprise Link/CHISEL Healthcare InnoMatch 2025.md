<summary><strong>16 Bit</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p><strong>Company Description:</strong>
<br>16 Bit is a Canadian medical imaging AI company founded by radiologists,
developing Rho™, an opportunistic osteoporosis screening tool. By analyzing
routine X-rays, Rho identifies patients with low bone mineral density who
may benefit from DXA testing. Their mission is to improve the quality,
efficiency, and accessibility of preventive healthcare globally.
<br>
<br><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p>Rho™ is a Health Canada, U.S. FDA, Australian TGA and Singapore HSA–approved
AI software-as-a-medical-device (SaMD) that enables opportunistic osteoporosis
screening using routine X-rays. Osteoporosis often remains undiagnosed
until fractures occur, yet millions of chest, spine, pelvis, and extremity
X-rays are performed each year without bone health assessment. Rho analyzes
these existing images to generate a score from 1 to 10, identifying patients
at increased risk of low bone mineral density. Patients with a positive
Rho result (score ≥ 6) can then be referred for DXA scanning, the diagnostic
gold standard. This approach unlocks new value from existing imaging workflows,
improves early detection rates, and facilitates preventive interventions
to reduce fracture risk. Deployed in radiology, orthopedic and primary
care clinics, Rho supports clinicians in identifying at-risk patients,
increases DXA referrals, and strengthens quality of care while generating
new revenue opportunities for providers. With approvals across multiple
regulatory jurisdictions and expanding partnerships in the Americas, Asia,
and Europe, Rho is poised to become the global standard for opportunistic
osteoporosis screening.</p>

<summary><strong>GyroGear Pte Ltd</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p><strong>Company Description:</strong>
<br>GyroGear is a neurotech company restoring independence to people with
hand tremors. Our flagship product, GyroGlove 1.0, is the world’s most
advanced hand stabiliser. It uses high performance mechanical gyroscopes
to instantly steady the hand. Non-invasive and drug-free, it empowers users
to regain confidence and control in daily life.
<br>
<br><strong>Solution:</strong>
<br>Approximately 200 million individuals globally suffer from lifelong, incurable
hand tremors (Parkinson’s disease, essential tremor). Today’s therapies
are inadequate - medication has significant side effects, whilst neurosurgery
remains risky. Wearable options remain extremely limited. GyroGlove 1.0
thus provides instant restoration of quality of life. Yet patients face
minimal long-term care options - misdiagnoses are high, treatment options
are limited, and tremors are extremely variable and poorly understood clinically.
Navigating side-effects, physiotherapy, mental health, stigma etc in old
age is taxing. We are thus building GyroCare, the world’s first tremor
management ecosystem. GyroGlove instantly steadies hands, whilst embedded
sensors quantify tremor patterns. Patients gain real-time feedback and
restored independence; clinicians receive objective, longitudinal data
to guide treatment. Integration of patient and clinician access greatly
accelerates optimisation of GyroCare’s AI and interaction interfaces. Reinforcement
learning algorithms adapt to highly variable tremor severities, subtypes
and progression, providing timely, clinically meaningful alerts while conserving
device energy. Users and families finally have organised, actionable information
of a complex, life-long condition. Physicians too have always asked us
for continuous monitoring, early warnings, multimodal treatment optimisation,
multi-disease capability etc.</p>
