<h2>Theme</h2>
<p>Hospitals currently face significant challenges in the delivery of healthcare,
including increasing patient complexities, the need to provide better,
more accessible care, and operational inefficiencies. These challenges
often lead to sub-optimal patient outcomes and increasing cost pressures.
Therefore, hospitals must be embracing a transformative shift toward digital
systems that deliver exceptional patient value, by providing patients with
Better Access, High Quality and Efficient Care.</p>
<h3>Building the Digital Health of the Future</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Problem Statement</strong>
</p>
<p>How can digital solutions (e.g. AI-enhanced Digital Platforms or Devices)
seamlessly <strong>integrate care within and beyond</strong> hospitals to
create a future-ready, patient-centric healthcare model that enhances access
to care, improves quality of care, increases operational efficiency, and <strong>enables discharge and continuing care</strong>,
with the objective of providing greater value to patients?</p>
<p>&nbsp;This theme seeks disruptive innovations that can benefit diverse
populations and empower care for patients. The proposal shall focus on
the following key areas and should ideally be backed by clinical evidence
and data:</p>
<p>&nbsp;1.&nbsp; AI solutions for clinical decision support, analytics,
operations quality assurance, discharge planning and transitional care.</p>
<p>2. Devices and Automation for smart wards and clinics for patient care
delivery, optimizing manpower, reducing admin tasks and enabling care transitions;
allowing more time for patients.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Digital Applications for clinician support, and patient engagement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Your solution and proposal outcomes should be backed by clinical
evidence and data. Submit your application today to pioneer digital solutions
that will improve patient outcomes, enhance the healthcare experience,
and transform the way we deliver care.</p>
<h2>Funding and Collaborations</h2>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CHISEL/funding_.png">
</div>
<p>Successful winners in CHISEL Healthcare InnoMatch 2025 will obtain funding
support to demonstrate their solutions in operational environments and
will receive further endorsement from our partner healthcare clusters upon
successful validation of the results of pilot implementation. Ultimately,
the platform aims to accelerate the adoption of near-market-ready and fit-for-mainstream-use
healthcare innovation, bringing them a step closer to benefit patients.</p>

<p>Successful winning start-ups and SMEs will be matched to one of the participating
healthcare clusters to carry out test-bedding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Winners will be granted three (3) months of preparation time to
finalise the project agreement (and additional three (3) months if ethics
approval is required); up to nine (9) months to complete test-bedding;
and up to three (3) months to complete the evaluation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Test-Bedding Phase (Oct 2025 – Dec 2026 )</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Refine the test-bed protocol and
define success criteria of the test-bed with your partner healthcare cluster.
You would also define the pricing for subsequent purchase, subject to the
solution meeting pre-agreed success criteria. You may be required by your
partner hospital to supplement more documentation to facilitate the test-bedding
and potential adoption.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Project Agreement should be set
up within three (3) months (an additional three (3) months may be granted
if ethics approval is required).</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Test-bedding should start no later
than Apr 2026. Complete test-bedding in a simulated and/or clinical environment
complying to regulations and institutional policies with your partner healthcare
cluster. Test-beds should be completed within nine (9)) months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Evaluation Phase (Jan 2027 &nbsp;– Mar 2027)</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon completion of the test-bedding
phase, the partner healthcare clusters would evaluate the success of the
test-bed.</p>
<p>All CHISEL 2025 &nbsp;test-bed solutions are to be evaluated using the
<a href="https://www.chi.sg/platforms-and-programmes/chief/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CHI Evaluation Framework (CHIEF)</a>. CHIEF is a holistic framework for
the evaluation of innovative solutions seeking real world deployment. Evaluation
costs should be included in your application. You may also engage additional
services (e.g. statistical analysis, study design, sample calculation etc.)
from CHIEF or an independent expert for the purposes of the test-bed at
your discretion.</p>
