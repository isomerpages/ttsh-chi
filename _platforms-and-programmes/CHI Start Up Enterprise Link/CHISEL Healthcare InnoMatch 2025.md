<h2>Theme</h2>
<p>Hospitals currently face significant challenges in the delivery of healthcare,
including increasing patient complexities, the need to provide better,
more accessible care, and operational inefficiencies. These challenges
often lead to sub-optimal patient outcomes and increasing cost pressures.
Therefore, hospitals must be embrace a transformative shift toward digital
systems that deliver exceptional patient value, by providing patients with
Better Access, High Quality and Efficient Care.</p>
<h3>Building the Digital Health of the Future</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Problem Statement</strong>
</p>
<p>How can digital solutions (e.g. AI-enhanced Digital Platforms or Devices)
seamlessly <strong>integrate care within and beyond</strong> hospitals to
create a future-ready, patient-centric healthcare model that enhances access
to care, improves quality of care, increases operational efficiency, and <strong>enables discharge and continuing care</strong>,
with the objective of providing greater value to patients?</p>
<p>&nbsp;This theme seeks disruptive innovations that can benefit diverse
populations and empower care for patients. The proposal shall focus on
the following key areas and should ideally be backed by clinical evidence
and data:</p>
<p>&nbsp;1.&nbsp; AI solutions for clinical decision support, analytics,
operations quality assurance, discharge planning and transitional care.</p>
<p>2. Devices and Automation for smart wards and clinics for patient care
delivery, optimizing manpower, reducing admin tasks and enabling care transitions;
allowing more time for patients.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Digital Applications for clinician support, and patient engagement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Your solution and proposal outcomes should be backed by clinical
evidence and data. Submit your application today to pioneer digital solutions
that will improve patient outcomes, enhance the healthcare experience,
and transform the way we deliver care.</p>
