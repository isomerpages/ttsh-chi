<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>If I am an overseas winner of CHISEL InnoMatch, would I need to relocate to Singapore during the test-bedding?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Relocating or setting up a local office in Singapore is not mandatory.
However, we do strongly advise and encourage winners to build local contacts
or partnerships e.g. local distributors. This is to facilitate communication
and provide local support to the partner healthcare cluster you are paired
with for the test-bedding. A local presence would help build a long-term
partnership (especially if the test-bedding results are favourable).</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Do I need to find my own partner healthcare institutions or clinicians for the submission?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>No, you do not have to. Through CHISEL, the winning teams will be paired
up with the interested healthcare institutions at the end of the Finale.
The paired healthcare institution will help you to identify the clinical
project lead that you will be working with for the test-bedding.</p>
