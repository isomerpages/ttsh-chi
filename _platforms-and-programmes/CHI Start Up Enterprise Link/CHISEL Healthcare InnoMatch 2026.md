<h2>Theme</h2>
<p>As the Singapore healthcare system face mounting pressures from workforce
shortages and increasing demand, AI-enabled solutions emerge as vital enablers
to enable and complement human expertise. The integration of artificial
intelligence and advanced technology revolutionises healthcare by empowering
workers with tools that enhance their capabilities and improve patient
outcomes. This technological transformation allows healthcare professionals
to support clinical decision-making, deliver more precise and efficient
care, ultimately creating a more responsive and effective healthcare workforce.</p>
<h3>Enhancing Health through an AI and Tech-Enabled Workforce</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Problem Statement</strong>
</p>
<p>How might we leverage AI and tech-empowered solutions to trnsform our
healthcare workforce to create a holistic care delivery system across all
care settings and patient touchpoints that drives productivity gains, improves
cost efficiency, and delivers significantly improved health outcomes for
patients?</p>
<p>This theme seeks disruptive innovations that can empower the workforce
to greater benefit diverse patient groups. The proposal shall focus on
the following three key levels:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>At the <strong>individual level</strong>, using <strong>Clinical Decision Support Tools</strong>,
healthcare providers can make more informed, accurate diagnoses and treatment
decisions as well as better determine appropriate care settings for patients,
enhancing a healthcare worker’s efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the <strong>institutional level</strong>, using <strong>AI-Driven Workforce Scheduling Systems</strong> or <strong>Smart Multi-disciplinary Care Planning</strong> for
complex or chronic disease management to effectively deploy healthcare
staff, optimise care protocols, resource allocation and care monitoring,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the <strong>systemic level</strong>, using <strong>Predictive Analytics</strong>, <strong>AI-Enabled Care Pathway Standardisation, </strong>or <strong>Population Health Management Systems </strong>to
identify high-risk patients, standardize clinical protocols, and provide
more targeted intervention treatments, addressing systemic challenges and
enhancing care quality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your solution and proposal outcomes should be strongly backed by clinical
evidence and data. Innovative solutions that directly impact clinical care
will take priority over those focused on health administration capacity
and productivity improvements.</p>
<p><strong><u>Applications will open soon in February 2026</u></strong>.
Submit your application to pioneer transformation in our healthcare workforce
that will improve health outcomes, enhance the healthcare experience for
patients, and transform the way we deliver care.</p>
