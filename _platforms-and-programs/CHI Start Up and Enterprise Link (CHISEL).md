The Healthcare InnoMatch 2022 by Temasek Foundation, Ministry of Health and the Centre for Healthcare Innovation (CHI) are calling for **innovative, market-ready or near market-ready solutions to address critical and emerging healthcare needs!**

  
Organised in partnership with SingHealth Services (SHS), National University Health System (NUHS) and National Healthcare Group (NHG), the Healthcare InnoMatch 2022 is seeking solutions that can enhance patient care and deliver positive health outcomes with the theme: **Delivering Care Beyond Hospital Walls.** This encompasses solutions that bridge the gap between hospital and home/community; including preventive and predictive care, transition of care, and patient activation for better self-management of care.

  
Successful proposals in the Healthcare InnoMatch 2022 will **obtain funding support** to demonstrate their solutions in operational environments, and will **receive further endorsement from our partner healthcare clusters** upon successful validation of the results of pilot implementation. Ultimately, the platform aims to bridge the market adoption gap, and allow patients early access to new and emerging healthcare innovations to address our critical healthcare needs.
