<p>It takes a whole kampung to enable a person to maintain good health and
self-care in the comfort of their homes. As our population ages and the
burden of chronic diseases rises, we recognise the need for close collaborations
with our health and social care partners in the community to enable neighbourhood-based
care to thrive.
<br>
<br>Launched in 2017, the <strong>Centre for Health Activation (CHA) </strong>was
set up to focus on Activation, Research and Training – also known as the <strong>ART of CHA</strong>.</p>
<p>Its vision is to drive activation and build One Community of Carers (i.e.,
patients, caregivers, volunteers, health, and social care partners) who
are equipped with the skills, knowledge, and confidence to self-care and
care for their loved ones and others in the community.</p>
