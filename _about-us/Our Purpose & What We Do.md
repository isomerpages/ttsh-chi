# Innovation is key to sustainable healthcare.

Singapore is facing a fast ageing population and shrinking workforce. It is essential for Singapore’s healthcare system to innovate, seek new ways to improve productivity and add value to our patients. This ensures that our patients will continue to receive high quality and cost-effective care in the future.

# Co-learning enables us to achieve more together.

We believe in knowledge sharing and learning together. At CHI, there are no borders when it comes to learning. It is our mission to engage like-minded institutions and agencies to co-learn and co-create new healthcare innovations and new ways of learning.

# Our Purpose

# CHI Innovation Cycle
#####  System Innovation
![](/images/au_system_innovation.png)
We believe that to achieve, spread and sustain innovation, a systems approach is required. The Innovation Cycle is a framework to describe the macro stages for planning, implementing and improving upon innovation initiatives. The framework comprises three sequential stages, with each stage supported by iterative Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle(s).<br>
The cycle advocates that <br>(1) the first step to innovation in healthcare is to redesign the care/process to optimize value for patients and reduce waste, followed by <br>(2) automation of a waste-free process. By leveraging automation and adopting technology to take over simple, repetitive but necessary jobs, manpower resources are freed up. This presents <br>(3) an opportunity to review the staffs’ current roles and redesign their jobs, so that each staff performs more meaningful work at the top of his or her competencies.<br>
The Innovation Cycle is a deliberate and iterative framework to describe and improve upon the process of improvement. If applied well, the framework can serve as a toolkit to guide the planning and implementation of strategic initiatives, to deliver value.
