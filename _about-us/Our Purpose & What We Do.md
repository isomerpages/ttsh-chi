# Innovation is key to sustainable healthcare.

Singapore is facing a fast ageing population and shrinking workforce. It is essential for Singaporeâ€™s healthcare system to innovate, seek new ways to improve productivity and add value to our patients. This ensures that our patients will continue to receive high quality and cost-effective care in the future.

# Co-learning enables us to achieve more together.

We believe in knowledge sharing and learning together. At CHI, there are no borders when it comes to learning. It is our mission to engage like-minded institutions and agencies to co-learn and co-create new healthcare innovations and new ways of learning.
