# Innovation is key to sustainable healthcare.

Singapore is facing a fast ageing population and shrinking workforce. It is essential for Singaporeâ€™s healthcare system to innovate, seek new ways to improve productivity and add value to our patients. This ensures that our patients will continue to receive high quality and cost-effective care in the future.

# Co-learning enables us to achieve more together.****

We believe in knowledge sharing and learning together. At CHI, there are no borders when it comes to learning. It is our mission to engage like-minded institutions and agencies to co-learn and co-create new healthcare innovations and new ways of learning.
