<h2>People Development Office</h2>
<h4><em>Co-Learn, Transform, Create a Resilient Workforce</em></h4>

The People Development team plays a crucial role in transforming the healthcare workforce in preparation for tomorrow’s challenges.
<br><br>
The team drives workforce transformation for Tan Tock Seng Hospital and Central Health through the yearly “Learning Needs Analysis” exercise, which caters to the business needs of the various healthcare family groups, as well as the specific needs and aspirations of our staff. This is supported by the curation and administration of a comprehensive suite of both in-house and external programmes, that have been specially designed by domain experts. 
<br><br>
As believers of colearning and sharing, the team manages the facilities of the Ng Teng Fong Centre for Healthcare Innovation, a premier MICE venue to support training, conferences and events.
