<h2>People Development Office</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The CHI People Development (PD) Office plays a crucial role in developing
the capability and capacity of the healthcare workforce and also in nurturing
a culture that is rooted in our core values, shared language and collective
leadership.</p>
<p>PD is instrumental in driving workforce transformation. Together with
other embedded professional groups, we ensure that hospital staff are equipped
with the latest knowledge and skills to meet the business and clinical
needs of the hospital. This is achieved by identifying and bridging the
gap between current workforce competencies and the evolving demands of
healthcare services through a comprehensive learning needs analysis. This
enhances individual career paths and also ensures the hospitalâ€™s readiness
to face future healthcare challenges.</p>
<p>PD also oversees the provision of scholarships and funding streams for
employees seeking further education and professional growth with a focus
on leadership and capability development, thereby nurturing a pipeline
of high skilled healthcare professionals. Moreover, together with HR and
the Organisational Development teams, we design and implement leadership
development programs that are aimed at cultivating leaders who will help
guide and propel the organisation towards achieving its strategic objectives
while maintaining a high standard of care and operational efficiency.</p>
<p>The team also manages the facilities of the Ng Teng Fong Centre for Healthcare
Innovation to avail a best-in-class environment for training excellence,
conferences and events.</p>
