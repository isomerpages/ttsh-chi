<h2>Grants and Innovation Office</h2>
<h4><em>Seed, Drive, Promote Innovations</em></h4>
<p>The CHI Grants and Innovation Office seeds, drives and promotes the spread
and scale of innovation in order to enhance the health of our patients
and the population we serve. We achieve this through the following initiatives:
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Ng Teng Fong Healthcare Innovation Programme (NTF HIP)</p>
<p>A $52 million funding lever to seed and capitalise healthcare innovation
towards building leadership, and transforming the workforce in care redesign,
IT and automation, and job redesign.</p>
<p>National Healthcare Innovation and Productivity (HIP) Medals</p>
<p>Organised by CHI, and sponsored by MOH, the National HIP Medals is a prestigious,
national-level award that recognises local healthcare and community care
institutions that have demonstrated thought leadership through bringing
about health and social change, as well as the implementation of innovative,
productivity projects. The Medals provides recognition in 3 award categories:
Care Redesign; Automation, IT and Robotics Innovation; and Workforce Transformation.</p>
<p>CHI Learning and Development (CHILD) System</p>
<p>A national Knowledge Management (KM) solution funded by MOH to provide
a central repository for healthcare institutions, industry players and
academia to accelerate the sharing, exchange and co-creation of knowledge,
as well as the development of emerging ideas.</p>
<p>CHI Start-up Enterprise Link (CHISEL)</p>
<p>CHISEL is an end-to-end framework that converges healthcare needs and
solutions to leapfrog the transition from market-ready status, to fit-for-mainstream
use.
<br>
<br>Within the community, CHISEL bridges the health x social care ecosystems
to bring about innovations that support digital Communities of Care.</p>
