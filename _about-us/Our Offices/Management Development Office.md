<h1>Management Development Office</h1>

<h5>Transforming Leaders, Transforming Care</h5>
The establishment of the Management Development Office (MDO) aims to collectively build a pipeline of future healthcare leaders for Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) and Central Health. Through a comprehensive range of structured and progressive programmes, MDO shifts from recruitment to selection model, equipping management trainees with the necessary skills and competencies for their future roles.  <br><br>
There are 3 Management Development Programmes (MDP) managed by MDO:<br><br>
1.	<b>Healthcare Management Associate Programme (HMAP) </b>started in 2009, aimed at grooming graduates with outstanding leadership qualities for a challenging and fulfilling career ahead in the National Healthcare Group (NHG). HMAP represents a collaborative effort with other healthcare institutions within the NHG, cultivating the growth of a collective programme to expand the range of learning and network building opportunities. <br>
2.	<b>Management Executive Programme (MEP)</b> started in 2012, aimed at building capabilities of high performing executives to take on managerial roles.  <br>
3.	<b>Management Fellowship Programme (MFP)</b> started in 2009, aimed to develop and nurture high performing managers and clinicians to take on future healthcare leadership roles. <br><br>

The introduction of HMAP, MEP and MFP establishes a comprehensive developmental framework catering to different levels, promoting a holistic approach of growth and career advancement. The MDPs prepare and empower young, aspiring staff with the relevant knowledge, experience and exposure they require for the prospective roles.  <br>
MDO garners strong support from respective Programme Advisors, Programme Sponsors, HR partners and MDP Committee comprising of senior leaders from the NHG Institutions and TTSH. This collective leadership is instrumental in facilitating the leadership pipeline planning, transforming aspiring leaders to spearhead changes within healthcare. <br>
MDO is committed to the mission in building a pipeline of future-ready leaders for the organisation, co-creating the future of healthcare.
