<h2>Learning and Organisation Development</h2>
<p>The Learning &amp; Organisation Development (L&amp;OD) Office oversees
three people-related functions, namely Learning &amp; Development, Organisation
Development, as well as MICE Management.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Learning and Development</h3>
<p><em>Driving Workforce Transformation and Capability Development for Healthcare</em>
</p>
<p>Learning and Development (L&amp;D) plays a vital role in enhancing the
capability and capacity of the healthcare workforce while fostering a culture
rooted in core values, shared language, and collective leadership.</p>
<p>L&amp;D is instrumental in driving workforce transformation, together
with Kaizen Office, and Collaborating Centres Support Office. These offices
drive initiatives to spread and scale job redesign efforts, enhance workforce
capabilities, and equip staff with the skills required for driving person-centred
and innovative care models. This will involve scaling structured learning
pathways, improving organisational health, and embedding lean transformation
practices across all levels, ensuring that the healthcare workforce will
remain agile, empowered, and future ready.</p>
<p>In support of CHI’s strategic priorities, L&amp;D's efforts are focused
in these areas:</p>
