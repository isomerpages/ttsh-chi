<h2> CHI Academies Office </h2> 

The Academy Office is a central management body supporting three key academies under Centre for Healthcare Innovation (CHI): CHI Value Academy (CHI VA), CHI Sustainability Academy (CHI SA), and CHI Health and Social Change Academy (CHI HSCA). 

Each academy plays a vital role in advancing healthcare practices, sustainability efforts, and community well-being, collectively contributing to CHI's mission of driving innovation and positive change in the healthcare sector.
