<summary>CHI Health and Social Change Academy</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>CHI HSCA aims to build capability for HealthierSG to help shift the gravity
of care from the hospital to the community, where the focus is on health
and residents and not just disease and patients. New care models anchored
on population health management, health activation, collective leadership,
and mobilisation of resources across health and social sectors will be
key to achieve this transformation. This requires new skills, knowledge
and capabilities for health and social care providers.
