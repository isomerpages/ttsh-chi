<h2>Academies Office</h2>
<p>The Academies Office serves as a central support hub for <strong>three </strong>distinct
yet interconnected academies within CHI (Centre for Healthcare Innovation),
each focusing on different levels of healthcare transformation.</p>
<p>The office coordinates and supports these <u>three key academies:</u>
</p>
<p><strong>CHI Value Academy (VA)</strong> - Operates at the care level, empowering
healthcare providers to transition from cost-based to value-based care
delivery and payment models.</p>
<p><strong>CHI Health and Social Change Academy (HSCA)</strong> - Works at
the systems level to shift healthcare towards preventive care and community-based
delivery through leadership and capability development.</p>
<p><strong>CHI Sustainability Academy (SA)</strong> - Functions at the ecosystem
level to develop circular healthcare economy capabilities and drive environmental
sustainability in healthcare delivery.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Academies Office plays a crucial role in ensuring these three academies
work harmoniously towards their shared goal of building a more resilient
and reliable healthcare system that delivers value for patients, promotes
population health, and ensures sustainability for future generations.</p>
