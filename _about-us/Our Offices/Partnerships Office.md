<h2>Partnership &amp; Communications</h2>
<h4><em>Connect, Collaborate, Convene</em></h4>
The Partnership &amp; Communications (P&amp;C) Office connects innovators and adopters, drive collaborations between partners in the industry with healthcare stakeholders, convene healthcare professionals and industry players to build thought leadership, and together achieve better health and healthcare for the people. <br><br>
The team manages the CHI Co-Learning network of local and international partners from Academia, Strategic Agencies, Healthcare Clusters, Community Partners and Industry Knowledge Partners.<br><br>
The P&amp;C team will:<br>

* <b>Connect</b> healthcare stakeholders with industry partners to drive innovative developments or co-learning opportunity. When presented with an innovative idea/process that requires further development with expertise beyond the innovator’s expertise, the P&amp;C team will connect with relevant partners to enable the advancement of an innovative idea.<br>
*	<b>Collaborate</b> and form value-enabling alliances for healthcare transformation. The team brokers opportunities for partnerships, sponsorships, co-learning initiatives, grants, and events to catalyse value based outcomes<br>
*	<b>Convene</b> like-minded innovators in promoting a culture of innovation through thought leadership with a flywheel of co-learning networks. The team frequently organises the sharing and exchange of the latest in healthcare developments, innovative initiatives and workforce transformation at CHI Signature programmes, such as the CHI Masterclass. Rich conversations with thought leaders and innovators are communicated to healthcare professionals and the community via CHI’s social media platforms, online publication PULSE@CHI, and the official podcast, CHI AMPED.<br><br>

Together, we will meet current and future healthcare challenges through innovative and value-driven care delivery to the populations we serve.  <br><br>
