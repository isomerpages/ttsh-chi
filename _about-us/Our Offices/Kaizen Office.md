# Who Are We?

<h3>Facilitator, Coach, Change Agent…</h3><br>

We were formed in 2007 to help establish lean methodology for process improvement. This lean movement was required by our hospital to prepare for greater demands and complexities in the future, brought about by a greying population. Overtime, to ensure that our staff are constantly empowered and equipped to deal with complex problems in a VUCA* environment, we have also embraced Design Thinking and Change Management principles to strengthen our approach in facilitating improvement and innovation.<br><br>

Today, we support CHI and TTSH in driving improvement and innovation  through facilitating change and capability building.<br><br>

*VUCA - Volatile, Uncertainty, Complexity and Ambiguity

<h3>What we do?</h3>
