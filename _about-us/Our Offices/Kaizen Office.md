<h2>Kaizen Office</h2>
<h4><em>Facilitator, Coach, Change Agent</em></h4>
<p>The Kaizen Office was formed in 2007 to help establish lean methodology
for process improvement. This lean movement was required to prepare healthcare
for greater demands and complexities in the future, brought about by an
aging population.
<br>
<br>Overtime, to ensure that our staff are constantly empowered and equipped
to deal with complex problems in a VUCA* environment, we have also embraced
Design Thinking and Change Management principles to strengthen our approach
in facilitating improvement and innovation.
<br>
<br>Today, we support healthcare in driving improvement and innovation through
facilitating change and capability building.
