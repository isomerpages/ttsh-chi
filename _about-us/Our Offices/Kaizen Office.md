<h2>Kaizen Office </h2>
<h4><em>Facilitator, Coach, Change Agent</em></h4>
The Kaizen Office was formed in 2007 to help establish lean methodology for process improvement. This lean movement was required to prepare healthcare for greater demands and complexities in the future, brought about by an aging population. <br><br>
Overtime, to ensure that our staff are constantly empowered and equipped to deal with complex problems in a VUCA* environment, we have also embraced Design Thinking and Change Management principles to strengthen our approach in facilitating improvement and innovation.<br><br>
Today, we support healthcare in driving improvement and innovation through facilitating change and capability building.<br><br>
<small>*VUCA - Volatile, Uncertainty, Complexity and Ambiguity</small>

Our team of friendly and trained facilitators are entrusted to:

*	Equip staff with the appropriate knowledge and tools to proactively carry out improvements and innovations
*	Work with our staff to facilitate and sustain improvements and innovations
*	Build the necessary infrastructure for sharing and standardisation so that improvement and innovation efforts can be easily spread and learnt
*	Collaborate with staff and the management to build a culture of empowerment and proactive involvement
