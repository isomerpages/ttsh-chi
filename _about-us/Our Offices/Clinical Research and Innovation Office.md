### <b>Clinical Research &amp; Innovation Office (CRIO)</b><br>
The Clinical Research &amp; Innovation Office (CRIO) leads, promotes and coordinates research culture and activities to support the development of Singapore into a reputable world-class research hub, aligning its mission with Singapore’s emphasis on life science biomedical research. <br><br>
The CRIO team fosters research across the whole spectrum from basic biomedical research to health services and population health research. The team is experienced in life sciences research and clinical trials, both for academic and pharmaceutical company-sponsored studies. The research coordinators and assistants are certified with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and are well-versed with Singapore’s research regulatory requirements. <br><br>
CRIO is committed to constantly upgrade our capabilities to support both investigators and pharmaceutical companies in conducting biomedical research and clinical trials. To further CRIO’s objective in research and innovation, here are some of our areas of expertise:<br><br>
•	Facilitate agreements that safeguard the hospital and its stakeholders’ interests. These agreements ensure that every study/ trial is conducted according to all applicable laws and regulations, and the relevant ethics and regulatory requirements <br>
•	The Clinical Trials Unit is made up of a team of GCP- (Good Clinical Practice) and CITI (Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative)-certified clinical research coordinators who conduct both early and late phase trials. To find out more, please contact clinicaltrial@ttsh.com.sg. <br>
•	Clinical Research Support (CRS) unit consists of medical statisticians and epidemiologist that work closely with researchers through the research process; from the conceptualisation of ideas, developing study protocols, collecting and analysing the relevant data, and publication of research findings.<br>
•	The Strategic Research Programme Track, under the Ng Teng Fong Healthcare Innovation Programme (NTF HIP), is a platform set up to fund thematic Strategic Research Programmes that drive value through translational research, in order to achieve better patient outcomes, population health outcomes, and sustainable care. <br><br>

	<div class="para">The Agreements team plays a pivotal role in safeguarding TTSH and its stakeholders’ interests. We facilitate collaboration activities with external parties by enforcing appropriate research agreements – legally enforceable documents between two or more parties that are required for all TTSH research studies with/ without patient’s recruitment with and external party. These agreements ensure that every study/ trial is conducted according to all applicable laws and regulations, including TTSH/ NHG policies and the relevant ethics and regulatory requirements.

	<div class="para">The SRP Track, under the Ng Teng Fong Healthcare Innovation Programme (NTF HIP), is a platform set up to fund thematic Strategic Research Programmes that drive value through translational research, in order to achieve:<br><br>
•	Better patient outcomes<br>
•	Population health outcomes<br>
•	Sustainable care<br><br>
It is designed to intentionally steer funding towards “downstream” research that can be readily implemented into practice and translated into innovative care models.<br><br>
The SRP track will also enable the hospital to develop a pipeline of clinician-researchers who contribute effectively to TTSH’s mission as well as the national research and innovation landscape.<br><br>

 <img alt="Crio" src="/images/criooffice3.png">
		<b><u>Key Tenets</u></b><br>
•	<b>Synergistic</b>:  Designed to be multidisciplinary and integrated to maximize outcomes of research activities.<br>
•	<b>Translatable</b>: Develop evidence for new care models that can be adopted, for better patient outcomes not just in the individual, but also at the population level.<br>
•	<b>Impact</b>: Incorporate elements of social, behavioural, implementation and health services outcomes research into their proposals.<br><br>
 
<img alt="Crio" src="/images/criooffice4.png">
Each SRP is designed as a multi-year programme, guided by an overarching theme, where projects are organized according to thrusts and sub-themes, funded by NTF HIP as a foundational fund.<br>
The funding by NTF HIP will allow for SRPs to establish evidence for the implementation of new care models, setting researcher teams up for success in follow-on competitive funding opportunities such as those provided by National Research Foundation’s (NRF) Research and Innovation Enterprise (RIE) funding, development of new knowledge for furthering research, as well as seed a pipeline of research talent.<br><br>
