Clinical Research &amp; Innovation Office (CRIO) aims to lead, promote and coordinate research culture and activities to support the development of TTSH into a reputable world-class research centre.<br><br>
CRIO aligns its mission with Singapore’s emphasis on life science biomedical research. It supports the research endeavors of all the staff in TTSH.<br><br>
We foster research in TTSH across the whole spectrum from basic biomedical research to health services and population health research. Our staff at CRIO are experienced in life sciences research and clinical trials, both for academic and pharmaceutical company-sponsored studies. Our research coordinators and assistants are certified with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and are well-versed with Singapore’s research regulatory requirements. We monitor and standardize the research processes within the hospital.<br><br>
We are committed to constantly upgrade our capabilities to support both investigators and pharmaceutical companies in conducting biomedical research and clinical trials.
CRIO administers research collaboration especially with National Health Group, LKC School of Medicine, our preferred academic and natural partner, other research organizations and various government organizations.<br><br>
Our Vision<br><br>
Empowering clinical excellence through research and innovation<br><br>
Our Mission<br><br>
To provide comprehensive and sustainable research support for the Hospital by:<br>
-	Providing valued resources in a timely and professional manner<br>
-	Ensuring ethical and safety standards in the conduct of all types of research and innovation<br>

	<div class="para">The Agreements team plays a pivotal role in safeguarding TTSH and its stakeholders’ interests. We facilitate collaboration activities with external parties by enforcing appropriate research agreements – legally enforceable documents between two or more parties that are required for all TTSH research studies with/ without patient’s recruitment with and external party. These agreements ensure that every study/ trial is conducted according to all applicable laws and regulations, including TTSH/ NHG policies and the relevant ethics and regulatory requirements.

	<input id="title7" type="checkbox"><label for="title7">Strategic Research Program – Internal service  </label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
	<div class="para">The SRP Track, under the Ng Teng Fong Healthcare Innovation Programme (NTF HIP), is a platform set up to fund thematic Strategic Research Programmes that drive value through translational research, in order to achieve:<br><br>
•	Better patient outcomes<br>
•	Population health outcomes<br>
•	Sustainable care<br><br>
It is designed to intentionally steer funding towards “downstream” research that can be readily implemented into practice and translated into innovative care models.<br><br>
The SRP track will also enable the hospital to develop a pipeline of clinician-researchers who contribute effectively to TTSH’s mission as well as the national research and innovation landscape.<br><br>

 <img alt="Crio" src="/images/criooffice3.png">
		<b><u>Key Tenets</u></b><br>
•	<b>Synergistic</b>:  Designed to be multidisciplinary and integrated to maximize outcomes of research activities.<br>
•	<b>Translatable</b>: Develop evidence for new care models that can be adopted, for better patient outcomes not just in the individual, but also at the population level.<br>
•	<b>Impact</b>: Incorporate elements of social, behavioural, implementation and health services outcomes research into their proposals.<br><br>
 
<img alt="Crio" src="/images/criooffice4.png">
Each SRP is designed as a multi-year programme, guided by an overarching theme, where projects are organized according to thrusts and sub-themes, funded by NTF HIP as a foundational fund.<br>
The funding by NTF HIP will allow for SRPs to establish evidence for the implementation of new care models, setting researcher teams up for success in follow-on competitive funding opportunities such as those provided by National Research Foundation’s (NRF) Research and Innovation Enterprise (RIE) funding, development of new knowledge for furthering research, as well as seed a pipeline of research talent.<br><br>
