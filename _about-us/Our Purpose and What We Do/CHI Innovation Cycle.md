<p>
<br>We believe that to achieve, spread and sustain innovation, a systems approach
is required. The Innovation Cycle is a framework to describe the macro
stages for planning, implementing and improving upon innovation initiatives.
The framework comprises three sequential stages, with each stage supported
by iterative Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle(s).
<br>
<br>The cycle advocates that:
<br>(1) the first step to innovation in healthcare is to redesign the care/process
to optimize value for patients and reduce waste, followed by
<br>(2) automation of a waste-free process. By leveraging automation and adopting
technology to take over simple, repetitive but necessary jobs, manpower
resources are freed up. This presents
<br>(3) an opportunity to review the staffsâ€™ current roles and redesign their
jobs, so that each staff performs more meaningful work at the top of his
or her competencies.
<br>
<br>The Innovation Cycle is a deliberate and iterative framework to describe
and improve upon the process of improvement. If applied well, the framework
can serve as a toolkit to guide the planning and implementation of strategic
initiatives, to deliver value.</p>
