<h2>CHI Innovation and Transformation Cycle</h2>
<p>At the heart of CHI lies the<strong> Innovation Cycle,</strong> our systems-based,
iterative framework for planning, implementing, and improving innovation
initiatives.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p><strong>The CHI Innovation Cycle comprises three sequential stages:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Care and Process Redesign</strong>: Optimising value for patients
and reducing waste.</p>
<p><strong>Automation, IT, and Robotic Innovation:</strong> Leveraging technology
to streamline processes and free up manpower for higher-value work.</p>
<p><strong>Job Redesign:</strong> Reviewing and redesigning staff roles so
each person performs meaningful work at the top of their competencies.</p>
<p>This cycle is supported by continuous improvement principles, ensuring
sustainable change and lasting impact.</p>

<h2>CHI-X Transformation Cycle &amp; Three Futures</h2>
<p>To achieve system-wide impact, CHI developed the <strong>CHI-X Transformation Cycle</strong>,
embedding innovations across three levels:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Care Level (value for our patients):</strong> Maximising health
outcomes, improving access and affordability, and shifting from volume
to value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>System Level (health for our population):</strong> Focusing on
upstream preventive health, health equity, and integrated care for all
residents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ecosystem Level (sustainability for all generations):</strong> Championing
ecological, social, and workforce sustainability</p>
</li>
</ul>

</div>
<p></p>
<p>hese domains underpin CHI’s vision for <strong>Three Futures</strong>:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Future Care:</strong> Innovating care models for better access,
quality, and cost containment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Future Health:</strong> Transforming care beyond hospital walls
for healthier communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Future Generations:</strong> Building environmental and social
sustainability for generations to come.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>CHI-X brings together the Innovation Cycle and Transformation Cycle to
achieve these three futures, driving a circular economy of reinforcing
change and sustained transformation.</p>

<h2>CHI-ALL: Harnessing Collective Efforts</h2>
<p>Driving CHI-X is <strong>CHI-ALL</strong>—our system of collaborative networks,
centres, labs, academies, campuses, and offices. CHI-ALL brings together
people and resources to synergise, share knowledge, and leverage expertise,
harnessing collective efforts to drive innovation and transformation for
system change.</p>
