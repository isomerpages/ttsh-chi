<h1><strong>Innovating Future Care for Future Health and for Future Generations</strong></h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Centre for Healthcare Innovation (CHI) is an open co-learning platform
dedicated to adding years of healthy life. We drive value through innovation,
bringing together care redesign, technology, and workforce transformation
to achieve and sustain meaningful change in healthcare.</p>
<p>Healthcare needs are growing increasingly complexâ€”an ageing population,
a shrinking workforce, and the challenge of delivering greater value while
containing costs and improving quality. CHI recognises that what brought
us here will not take us further. The healthcare system of tomorrow requires
us to transform care delivery, population health, and sustainability by
spreading and scaling innovation beyond hospital walls, spearheading systems
change.</p>
