<h1>Innovation is key to sustainable healthcare.</h1>
<p>Singapore is facing a fast ageing population and shrinking workforce.
It is essential for Singaporeâ€™s healthcare system to innovate, seek new
ways to improve productivity and add value to our patients. This ensures
that our patients will continue to receive high quality and cost-effective
care in the future.</p>
<h1>Co-learning enables us to achieve more together.</h1>
<p>We believe in knowledge sharing and learning together. At CHI, there are
no borders when it comes to learning. It is our mission to engage like-minded
institutions and agencies to co-learn and co-create new healthcare innovations
and new ways of learning.</p>
<h1>Our Purpose</h1>
<h5>To spearhead change towards sustainable, value-based systems</h5>
