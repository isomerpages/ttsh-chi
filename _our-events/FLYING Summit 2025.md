<p>Organised by CHI FLYING in collaboration with the National Youth Council
(NYC), National Council of Social Services (NCSS) and the Commonwealth
Leadership Institute (CLI), we invite you to join us at the inaugural transformative
FLYING Summit where the next generation of leaders will converge to explore
our theme "Health IS Social" and shape the future of health.</p>

and international exchanges, young leaders will forge meaningful connections
whilst learning from experienced mentors. You'll witness groundbreaking
initiatives led by young visionaries and discover opportunities to scale
impactful projects that address health.</p>

we'll shape the future of health for generations to come.</p>
