<p>While there has been excitement on the potential of the use of AI in healthcare,
precious little has been adopted and scaled.</p>
<p>Why are some healthcare systems failing to show this while others have
demonstrated early success stories? Could it be that AI remains the purview
of think tanks, experts, early movers and leadership, where the familiarity
with, confidence and practice of AI have not yet touched frontliners, middle
managers, patients and our communities?</p>
<p>We believe that AI should be everybody's tool.</p>
<p>This conference will move beyond policy, the science and theory, but towards
the democratization of AI and challenge our horizons of where AI could
bring us to.</p>
<p>Join us on <strong><u>10 &amp; 11 July 2025</u></strong> as we commit to
extending our healing touch not just to patients, but to the future of
healthcare through the transformative power of AI.</p>
<p><strong>The conference will feature 4 different tracks:</strong>
