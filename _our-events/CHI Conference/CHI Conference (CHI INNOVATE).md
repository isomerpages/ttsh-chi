<h3>Sustainability in Healthcare</h3>

Healthcare’s sacred duty is to “Do No Harm” as we provide care for our patients; But this very duty has inflicted harm on the environment. If Healthcare were a country, we would be Earth’s 4th largest carbon emitter.

At the same time, the climate crisis is also a healthcare crisis.

The effects of global warming will bring an even larger tsunami of patients to our doors in the future.

CHI INNOVATE 2024, under the banner of “Sustainability in Healthcare”, will explore our relationship with our environment, while seeking innovative solutions to inspire and galvanise us to be ‘good ancestors’.&nbsp;

As a conference, we also aim to be an event with strong sustainable practices.

Join us on **4 &amp; 5 July 2024** as we pledge our oath to extend our healing touch not just to patients but to the planet we call home.
