<b><u>Population Health - Ambition into Action</u></b> <br>
			<b>Dr Jonty Heaversedge</b><br>
				<em>Chief Medical Officer and Chief Clinical Information Officer,<br>
South East London Integrated Care System <br>
Clinical Director, Imperial College Health Partners </em>
<br><br>
			Like most other health systems in the world, when the National Health System (NHS) in England was established, it was primarily focused on treating single conditions or illnesses. Since then both the understanding of disease and needs of the population have changed. People are living longer with multiple, complex, long-term conditions and increasingly require ongoing support from many different services and professionals. There is also a better understanding of the wider metabolic, behavioural, and environmental factors that are driving the increasing burden of ill-health, inequalities of outcome, and cost of care to society.<br>There is a growing realisation that this challenge cannot be met by health and care services alone – expanding current services to meet this need is unaffordable and a 'work-harder' approach will not help us to address these complex and multifactorial challenges. Increasingly health systems across the world are coming to the same conclusion – we need a fundamentally different approach – one which starts with our population and depends on strong partnership – not just between health and care providers but across government departments, community partners and, perhaps most importantly with our communities themselves.<br>These principles sit at the heart of current NHS reform and the introduction of Integrated Care Systems (ICSs) in England, but they are not new. Like other systems across the world, progress has been painfully slow, and whilst structural reform may help create the conditions for change it can easily belie the reality of the transformational challenge.<br>How do we translate these concepts into strategy, create a compelling vision that engages with our workforce, patients, and local communities, and prioritise action and investment to create impact? This requires a fundamental shift in mindset and method. We need to be clear how we think transformation happens in a complex system, how we create the conditions for improvement and innovation, develop enabling capabilities to catalyse change, and empower change-makers in our communities to unleash their energy and talent.<br>There is no 'right' answer and history would suggest that simply trying to replicate a solution in a different context is rarely successful. In this session Dr Jonty will share practical insights on prevention, primary care transformation, and population health management – to help accelerate our ambitions for happier, healthier populations in both England and Singapore.

<br><b>Mr Ralph Broad</b><br><em>Director, Inclusive Neighbourhoods Ltd<br>Founder, Local Area Coordination Network</em><br><br><b>Lessons Learned from the Development of Cost-Effective and Integrated Care Models for the Elderly in Toronto and Ontario, Canada</b><br><br>An aging population presents both a challenge and an opportunity to rethink how we organize and deliver elder care. Toronto’s Mount Sinai Hospital responded with the development of its Acute Care for Elders (ACE) strategy, led by Dr. Sinha which has demonstrated significant improvements in overall quality of care outcomes. It has reduced lengths of stay by 28 percent, lowered readmission rates by 14 percent and other adverse outcomes and inappropriate resource utilization through the successful implementation of evidence-informed care processes across the continuum of care, including integrating &amp; coordinating care for the elderly to community care settings. Using these learnings, Dr. Sinha has helped to further create upstream Ministry of Health interventions like exercise and falls prevention classes, community paramedicine programs, and stronger investments in home and community care and supportive housing through the Government of Ontario’s Seniors Strategy that have further worked to improve patient and system outcomes<br><br><b>Transforming Services &amp; Systems with Local Area Coordination in the UK</b><br><br>This Masterclass explores the design, development, implementation and long term outcomes of Local Area Coordination in England and Wales.Building on 30 years of international learning, Local Area Coordination is an integrated, evidence based approach to supporting people of all ages who may be facing complex life situations (including living with disabilities, mental health needs, ageing) and their families/carers to build and pursue their personal vision for a good life; stay strong/resilient, safe and connected as contributing citizens within their local communities; build practical, sustainable, local, non-service solutions to problems wherever possible; and build more welcoming, inclusive and supportive communities. Therefore, rather than waiting for crises and responding with services and money, it is about strengthening individuals and families – choice, control, opportunities and resilience; reducing isolation and loneliness, improving health and well-being; preventing or reducing demand for, or dependency on, costly services wherever possible; building community capacity and resilience; and supporting service reform and integration, having high quality services as a valued back up to local solutions.

<b><u>The Blueprint for Successful MedTech Innovation</u></b> <br><b>Prof Pascal Verdonck </b><br>
				<em>Professor of Medical Technology,<br>Ghent University, Belgium <br>Chief Executive Officer, MedTech Flanders</em><br>
			Technology and healthcare innovation often go hand in hand, with the aim to improve quality of life, life expectancy and offer new options for diagnosis and treatment. Yet healthcare leaders often need to balance innovation with cost effectiveness and efficiency of the healthcare system.<br>How then should a healthcare leader respond to the rise in healthcare innovation and its challenges?<br>How should we decide which innovations to prioritise? In this CHI Masterclass, Professor Pascal Verdonck will give insights into the fine balance between the health benefits and economic impact of innovation. With his deep expertise in the area of MedTech, he will provide fresh perspectives on challenges that innovation poses. Benefiting patients is essential but is that sufficient? Join us as we explore the possibilities, regulations and qualifications that are needed to supplement medical technology to reach beyond basic patient care. Go on a learning journey to understand the elements involved and the way forward with MedTech!

<b><u>Understanding Key Concepts in Systems Thinking</u></b> <br>
			<b>Dr Peter Senge</b><br>
<em>Founding Chair,<br>
Society for Organizational Learning (SoL)<br>
Senior Lecturer in Leadership and Sustainability,<br>
Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management</em><br>
<br>How might we transform and deal with complexities and moving pieces in large healthcare systems?<br>Having a vision without systems thinking, Senge says “ends up painting lovely pictures of the future with no deep understanding of the forces that must be mastered to move from here to there”. Systems thinking is ability to see the inter-dependencies of seemingly unrelated processes, and hinges on the intelligence of a collective. Enabling systemic change requires new ways of thinking and acting. This involves deep organisational learning, embracing a unique mix of different people, in different positions, who lead in different ways.<br>Join us in this CHI masterclass as we engage in a conversation with Senge to deepen understanding of key concepts in Systems Thinking, an invaluable perspective to foster aspiration towards our expanded healthcare mission.
