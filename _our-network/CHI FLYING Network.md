<p>FLYING is a network (150 members) that connects young health and social
care leaders across Singapore and beyond. We invite individuals below 40
years of age in the health and social care sector who desire to become
a change agent and have experience in leadership to join the CHI FLYING
network.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Our Objective</strong></h4>
<p>To raise up generations of young leaders across the health and social
care landscape who are better connected and united together with a common
understanding of each other and their perspectives to transform health
and social care in Asia and beyond, going Across Professions, Across Communities
and Across Borders.</p>
<h4><strong>What We Do</strong></h4>
<p>Recognising that the current issues and needs of an increasingly complex
landscape need interconnected solutions touching across multiple spectra,
CHI-FLYING was established to provide an inflection point for young leaders
across the health and social care landscape. By bringing together young
leaders across the spectrum to better understand and connect with each
other, we can build stronger interprofessional and inter-institutional
networks as the leaders develop and grow, increasing opportunity for cross-collaboration.</p>
<p>Through the events and opportunities available at FLYING, we seek to expand
membersâ€™ awareness and understanding of the transformations occurring in
the health and social care landscape and create opportunities where they
can drive change, providing opportunities to network, connect and launch
new initiatives together.</p>
