CHI Co-Learning Network
=================

The **CHI Co-Learning Network** was officially launched on 21 October 2016 with the objective of deepening co-learning and collaboration. Through the network, our partners can collaborate on innovation projects, form communities of practice and exchange knowledge. This will help to drive workforce transformation within and beyond the healthcare industry. The CHI Co-Learning Network comprises of 38 local and international like-minded innovation units across a multitude of industries. Bringing with them diverse yet synergistic expertise, partners in the Co-Learning network come together to establish an open community for co-learning and co-creating best practices in healthcare.

As part of our school’s term 2 inquiry on “Sharing the Planet”, the children in our school explored on our Earth’s biodiversity and how we humans are responsible in supporting and sustaining our biodiversity. Hence, this booth will showcase the children’s learning and the actions they have taken to protect and sustain our biodiversity.

|![](/images/book%20a%20tree%20logo%202.png)| **Book A Tree**. Book-A-Tree is a movement to support NParks in their mission to plant 1 million trees around Singapore to further enhance its status as a garden city. The movement is supported by the sales of the book "God's Own Design - A Photographic Journey Through Nature". All proceeds from the book sales would be donated to the Garden City Fund's Plant-A-Tree Programme. Specially created for those who love nature, the book "God's Own Design - A Photographic Journey Through Nature" is a visual treat from Singapore’s parks and nature reserves, punctuated with inspiring quotations. If you’re a tourist and wish to bring back a slice of Singapore with you, this book is just the perfect choice. If you’re living here, the book offers a beautiful way to both embrace and contribute toward Singapore’s natural beauty. When you buy the book, you’re also booking a tree because your contributions go towards planting new saplings that would be trees one day. Please join the Book-A-Tree movement and give birth to new trees, making Singapore even greener.|
