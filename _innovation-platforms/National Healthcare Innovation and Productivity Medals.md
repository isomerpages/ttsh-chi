Singaporeâ€™s healthcare system is transforming to better meet the needs of an ageing population and the increased prevalence of long-term complex health conditions.

Our Healthcare and Community Care institutions are determined to innovate and change to provide our population with better quality of life and health outcomes at a sustainable cost. Through care redesign, smart systems and technologies, and workforce redesign, we can better deliver value through innovation and productivity.

Supported by the Ministry of Health, the annual National Healthcare Innovation and Productivity (HIP) Medals provide an opportunity for Healthcare and Community Care institutions to acknowledge, showcase and celebrate excellence in healthcare innovation and productivity.
