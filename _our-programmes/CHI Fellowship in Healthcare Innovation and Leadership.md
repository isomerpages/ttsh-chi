#  CHI Fellowship in Healthcare Innovation and Leadership

The idea of the CHI Fellowship is to groom middle managers into health systems leaders, who are effective in leading change and transforming care with the health ecosystem. CHI Fellowship is a SG-UK collaboration with CHI partners, including Northern Care Alliance, Oxford Centre for Triple Value Healthcare, etc. Designed around the three stages of the CHI Innovation Cycle, the programme is practice-based and anchored on the participantâ€™s project, while combining professional development, coaching and mentoring, peer and experiential learning, fostering international and local network, innovation projects and immersions into other innovation healthcare systems in Singapore and beyond.
