&gt; Singapore is a nation “where we can create possibilities for ourselves beyond what we imagined possible.” –  Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong

The idea of the CHI Fellowship is to groom middle managers into health systems leaders, who are effective in leading change and transforming care with the health ecosystem. CHI Fellowship is a SG-UK collaboration with CHI partners, including Northern Care Alliance, Oxford Centre for Triple Value Healthcare, etc. Designed around the three stages of the CHI Innovation Cycle, the programme is practice-based and anchored on the participant’s project, while combining professional development, coaching and mentoring, peer and experiential learning, fostering international and local network, innovation projects and immersions into other innovation healthcare systems in Singapore and beyond.

Our vision for a digital-first Singapore is one where a [Digital Government](/about-smart-nation/digital-government), [Digital Economy](/about-smart-nation/digital-economy) and [Digital Society](/about-smart-nation/digital-society) harness technology to effect transformation in  health, transport, urban living, government services and businesses.

**Our Digital Government** continues to invest in infrastructure and create shared open platforms for our businesses and citizens to learn and develop. 

**Our Digital Economy** spurs businesses to invest in technology and talent to encourage growth beyond our shores.

**Our Digital Society** empowers individuals to cultivate their talents and arm themselves with the latest digital technologies to realise their biggest inspirations, and live better lives together.

The Smart Nation initiative is our way forward. Technology will be so seamlessly integrated that it will transform the way we work, live and play.

Learn more about the framework guiding our Smart Nation initiative: [Smart Nation: The Way Forward(1.4mb)](/files/publications/smart-nation-strategy-nov2018.pdf).The Fellowship fosters deeper understanding of the sector through personalised experience, and enhances the individuals existing skills, knowledge and experience. The development of a mentoring relationship that a young professional experiences here can influence future professional development and career advancement.

Successful participants who complete the programme will be invited to become CHI Fellows.
