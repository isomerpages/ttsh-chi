CHI Start-up Entreprise Link (CHISEL) InnoMatch 2024 is calling for innovative market-ready or near market-ready solutions to address critical and emerging healthcare needs!

### Theme
	
![](/images/CHISEL/2024_Theme.png)
Singapore is at the forefront of preparing for a super-aged society, anticipating that by 2023, 1 in 4 citizens will be aged 65 and above. The Age Well SG initiative, a comprehensive national program, underscores the commitment to support seniors in aging actively and independently within their homes and communities. However, the challenge lies in addressing the evolving and diverse care needs of the elderly, fostering holistic well-being, and enhancing the effectiveness of existing efforts. This year, besides calling for innovative and market-ready solutions to strengthen care for a healthier and resilient ageing society, CHISEL InnoMatch 2024 also introduces a ground-breaking theme: environmental sustainability in healthcare.

	<div class="accordion-content">
	<div class="para">Problem Statement:  

How might disruptive innovations enhance existing efforts, bridge critical gaps and fulfil unmet needs in the **holistic care** of the elderly and young seniors, so as to create **sustainable** (business model and environment perspective) **and personalised care models**?

We are seeking scalable, end-to-end and sustainable (business model and environment perspective) solutions to **promote** **personalised medical intervention**, **self-care**, and **right-sited care**. This may include solutions such as:
- Point of Care testing (i.e. diagnostic) solutions to transform disease diagnosis and support clinical decision to develop timely personalised care plans and/or treatments based on individuals' risk profiles.
- Digital innovations and Artificial Intelligence (AI) enhanced solutions that help to better predict, prevent and manage chronic diseases.
- Wearables and sensors to bring supportive care closer to home, empowering individuals to self-manage their health status and receive personalsied health and lifestyle coaching. This may pertain to eating healthily, increasing physical activities, taking their medications and routinely going for medical check-ups.

Problem Statement

How might we pioneer a transformative shift in the **hospitals’ management** of **healthcare waste, materials and energy** to minimise our environmental impact, without sacrificing quality and safety in patient care?

Your solution and proposal outcomes should be backed by clinical evidence and data. It should also aim to bring about better patient health outcomes, value and cost-effectiveness for patients, families, hospitals, and the overall healthcare systems. The environmental benefits of the innovation should be quantified. A key outcome is decarbonisation, which should be quantified in carbon dioxide equivalents or CO2e.

Submit your proposal today and contribute to extending our healing touch not only to patients but also to the delicate ecosystem we collectively call home. Together, let's forge a path towards healthcare sustainability.

### Prizes 

Successful winners in CHISEL InnoMatch 2024 will obtain funding support to demonstrate their solutions in operational environments and will receive further endorsement from our partner healthcare clusters upon successful validation of the results of pilot implementation. Ultimately, the platform aims to accelerate the adoption of near-market-ready and fit-for-mainstream-use healthcare innovation, bringing them a step closer to benefit patients.

You may be required by your partner hospital to supplement more documentation to facilitate the test-bedding and potential adoption.
- A Project Agreement should be set up within three (3) months (an additional three (3) months may be granted if ethics approval is required).
- Test-bedding should start no later than Apr 2024. Complete test-bedding in a simulated and/or clinical environment complying to regulations and institutional policies with your partner healthcare cluster. Test-beds should be completed within twelve (12) months.
