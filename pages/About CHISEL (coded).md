<h2> Centre for Healthcare Innovation Start-Up Enterprise Link (CHISEL) </h2>

Centre for Healthcare Innovation Start-Up Enterprise Link (CHISEL) is a programme that aims to accelerate the adoption of market-ready healthcare innovations that are fit for mainstream use, at speed at scale. <br>

It provides a sandbox and marketplace that enables start-ups and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to access real use cases and environments, and demonstrate proof-of-value (POV) of market ready or near market-ready solutions, with one of the three Singapore healthcare clusters as a primary collaborative test-bed site. The eventual aim is to bridge the gap between market-ready solutions and adoption, with the aim of procurement for use by healthcare institutions. <br>

Simultaneously, healthcare clusters are able to evaluate the operational feasibility of solutions prior to adoption or scale-up. The platform aims to bridge the market adoption gap, and allow patients early access to new and emerging healthcare innovations to meet healthcare gaps. 

Over 3 successful runs from 2021 to 2023, over **500 innovators** across **54 countries** have competed and **11 companies** were selected to test-bed their solutions that could enhance patient care and deliver positive health outcomes.<br><br>
